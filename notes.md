# Notes

### Times

* Start time: 9:15
* End time: 17:15
* Total time on project: ~6 hours (see below)

### Comments

* I took a long break after completing Part 2.  After the break I worked on parts 3 and 4 together since they were somewhat related.  My 4 hours (of project time) were up before my final commit.  I'd estimate I put closer to 6 hours in to get where I did.
* I didn't get around to refactoring to use useContext (the prop drilling was already getting out of hand).  It's messier than I'd like it to have left it.
* I'm happy to complete the project if you'd like to see how I'd have finished if I had more time.

### Known Issues

* I've never used a hosted version of `json-server`, and didn't figure out how to `POST` data to a schema.
* Wasn't able to get the page to automatically update the cards after saving the form(s), but the edits show up after a manual refresh (or changing the search term).
* I've used styled components in the past, and know there's a way to send props down through a styled component, but I didn't remember how off hand, and didn't have time to look it up.  Hence, the terribly styled form.
